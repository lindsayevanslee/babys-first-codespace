# babys-first-codespace

First foray into GitHub Codebases

Initialized with a blank template and then manually copied from `src/datascience-py-r` folder of [Data Science with Python and R](https://github.com/microsoft/datascience-py-r/tree/main) codespace by Microsoft.

Added `requirements.txt` to specify additional python packages to install (following pattern shown in `postCreateCommand` specification in `devcontainer.json`)

Can add more R packages via `apt-packages` but seems like there aren't many CRAN packages there:
